a powerful throw in a manner similar to a champion
discus thrower. The initiator throws his shield (light

must focus the attentions of his foes on him. Make
a melee attack, and if successful, the strike inflicts an
additional 10 points of damage. The aggravating pain
of this wound can cause a foe to react violently against
the initiator, forcing it to make a Will save (DC 12 +
initiation modifier) or it must attack him at its next
available action. This attack must be a melee attack if
the target his anything in hand that could be used as a
weapon or an improvised weapon (this includes bows

Prerequisites: 2 Scarlet Throne maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: One attack
Duration: Instant
Within the focus of the disciples mind, pathways
to victory form which he uses to sculpt and mold
the outcome of the battle. When an enemys attack
threatens to unravel these pathways, a supreme act
of will can restore order to them. The disciple makes
a Sense Motive check with a +4 competence bonus
opposing his enemys melee attack roll. If successful,
the attack is blocked and he may make an immediate
counter attack against that opponent at his full attack

Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instant
Mercy has a place on the battlefield, a disciple of
Scarlet Throne understands, as does the benefit of
an honorable and swift death. By showing his enemy
a merciful, swift death in battle, the disciple may
continue to his next victory while letting both keep
their honor. The disciple makes a melee attack against
an injured foe, and if the attack is successful and
the foe is under 25% of his maximum hit points, the
attack is treated as a coup de grace that is performed
as part of that attack action instead of the full round
action usually required. This does not provoke
attacks of opportunity. The attack does damage as a
critical hit, and the foe must make a Fortitude save
with a DC equal to 10 + the damage inflicted or die. If
the foe is above 25% of his maximum hit points, then
this maneuver has no effect and normal damage is
rolled. Disciples with this maneuver readied have a
keen sense of their enemys condition, and may make
a Sense Motive check as a free action (DC 20) to gauge
if their opponent is eligible to be finished by this
maneuver.

Target: You
Duration: Stance
Using the principles of shadow and light, the Solar
Wind disciple is capable of making phantom copies
of his ammunition for use in combat. While in this
stance, the initiator may make semi-real copies
of arrows, bolts, bullets, or throwing weapons by

Weapons that need reloading, such as crossbows and
firearms, are fully reloaded as a move action (and
if the character possesses the Rapid Reload feat, he
may reload as a swift action). Magical properties,
alchemical properties, or special materials of the
ammunition are not copied, only the base properties
of the ammunition (as if they were made of mundane
steel with no special abilities or properties). Once the
ammunition has been used, it disappears immediately
after the attack. If the bow, firearm, sling, or cross
bow making the attack has magical properties
these are bestowed upon the ammunition. Thrown
weapons copied by this stance are duplicates of the
original, but do not manifest the material portion of
the weapon, only its magical enhancements. Once

The target area (one 10-ft. by 10-ft. square) becomes
covered with phantom caltrops of softly glowing light
that cause the area to be considered difficult terrain
and act as vicious caltrops, using the initiators
initiation modifier as their attack bonus and inflicting
1d2 points of damage and halving the base speed
of any they manage to hit. Targets are denied their
armor bonus, shield bonus, and deflection bonus to

Duration: Instant
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Every disciple of Steel Serpent has long accepted
that in battle, sometimes the superior warrior gets
injured. The Steel Serpent however, believes that for

the blood lost from this attack sprays at the disciples
foe as a caustic acid. To use this counter, the disciple

with a +4 competence bonus; if successful, the target

points of bleed damage for 1d4 rounds following the
attack. Additional applications of this maneuver stack

A true master of the discipline of Steel Serpent
possesses the knowledge how to use his skill, ki, and
knowledge of the systems of living creatures, putting
them to use for ending of a life. When a disciple initiates
this maneuver and strikes a foe, he shows his deadly
intent and knowledge in a display of terrible force,
striking a foes heart chakra and sending a cascade of
poisonous ki through its body to annihilate the lifeforce
of the target. The disciple makes an attack against a foe
which if successful the target must make a Fortitude save
(DC 19 + initiation modifier). If this save fails, the target is
instantly slain as its bodys energies revolt and consume
it in a flash, reducing the body to ash (equipment is
unharmed). If the target succeeds on this save, its body
still suffers from the experience as the attack inflicts an
additional 50 points of damage. If the target dies from
this, its body also dissolves into ash. Victims slain by this
attack cannot be resurrected normally; a wish or miracle
spell must be cast first to restore the life-forceof the

Range: One melee attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instant
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
As the true dragon fights and employs all of its
mighty limbs in combat, so does the disciple that
emulates their graceful and deadly style. As part of this
strike, the initiator makes a normal melee attack and if
successful, the disciple makes an additional powerful
spinning kick, landing a heavy blow to his foe which
may temporarily rob it of its senses. The initiator
makes an attack against a foe at full base attack bonus.
If successful, the attack inflicts additional damage
equal his unarmed strike damage plus an additional
6d6 points of damage and potentially stuns his foe.
On a failed Fortitude saving throw (DC 16 + initiation
modifier) the foe is stunned for 1d4 rounds. If the
saving throw is successful, the foe is merely dazed for
one round. The character does not provoke attacks of
opportunity for not possessing the Improved Unarmed
Strike feat when using this strike, but additional
damage from this strike inflicts non-lethal damage
unless the character possesses that feat.

Level: 6
Prerequisites: 2 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: One ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instant
By focusing his will into one of his blades, the
Thrashing Dragon disciple wields the power of a
mighty great wyrm in the palm of his hand. The
initiator must make a ranged attack against a target
by throwing a light weapon with a range increment
(such as a dagger) or a signature Thrashing Dragon
weapon. If this attack is successful, the attack inflicts
an additional 9d6 points of damage.

Duration: Instant
When both of his blades strike home, the Thrashing
Dragon disciple may rend and tear with his blades to
cause excruciatingly painful and deadly injuries. As a
swift action after having made two successful attacks
with two wielded weapons (which inflict either
piercing or slashing damage) or natural weapons
that do slashing or piercing damage against a single
target, the initiator may rend his opponent inflicting
an additional 8d6 points of damage.
UNBREAKABLE TALONS
Discipline: Thrashing Dragon (Boost)
Level: 6
Prerequisites: 2 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: One turn
Using his superior skill and speed, the disciple knows
where and how to strike for maximum effectiveness.
By striking at the right angle, the disciples blades
set off discordant harmonies within the target for
increased destructive potential. When two-weapon
fighting with bladed weapons or with natural attacks
that inflict slashing damage, the disciples attacks
with those weapons inflict an additional 4d6 points
of damage for the round and strike as if they were
adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming
damage reduction or sundering items.
ALACRITY ON WING
Discipline: Thrashing Dragon (Counter)
Level: 7
Prerequisites: 2 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Instant
With reflexes honed from many combats, the disciple
may react to danger with speed so great he may even
attack multiple times while he evades the unlucky
attacker. The initiator makes an Acrobatics check
opposed by the targets attack roll. If successful the
attack is negated and the initiator may make a melee
attack with two wielded weapons or unarmed strikes,
each dealing an additional +2d6 points of damage.
BRUTAL DRAGONS STANCE
Discipline: Thrashing Dragon (Stance)
Level: 7
Prerequisites: 2 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
A Thrashing Dragon disciple sometimes realizes
that the best defense is having a field of lifeless
opponents at his feet. By adopting the mannerisms
of the rampant dragon, he inflicts heavy, chopping
blows that decimate his foes as he wades through
their broken forms. While in this stance and wielding
two-weapons, the initiator suffers a -2 penalty to
AC and gains a damage bonus to all melee attacks
and unarmed strikes equal to 2d6 + the initiators
initiation modifier.

Range: One melee attack
Target: Any adjacent target
Duration: Instant
By focusing on the principles of speed and power,
the Thrashing Dragon disciple explodes into motion,
making a vicious flurry of strikes against all nearby
attackers in a deadly dance of death. Make two attacks
with two-wielded weapons (making two attack rolls
with each weapon, effectively making four attacks)
against each adjacent enemy that surrounds the
initiator. If the initiator is capable of making an
unarmed strike or natural attack (through Improved
Unarmed Strike feat or natural weapons) then the
initiator may add in two additional attacks per target
using his unarmed or natural attack.
DOOM TALON
Discipline: Thrashing Dragon (Boost)
Level: 8
Prerequisites: 3 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Instant
When a potentially deadly strike occurs, the
Thrashing Dragon disciple knows how to make the
blow count. When the initiator makes an attack
roll that scores a critical threat, as a swift action
the initiator may automatically confirm this critical
hit and inflict an additional 4d6 points of damage.
Creatures immune to critical hits may still be affected
by this strike, not taking the normal double damage
but still suffering the additional 4d6 points of damage.
DRAGON WARRIORS TALONS
Discipline: Thrashing Dragon (Stance)
Level: 8
Prerequisites: 3 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
With mastery of the Thrashing Dragons dance comes
supremacy in effectiveness and efficiency with the
arms that emulate the weapons of the dragon race. His
mien is that of a ferocious, implacable dragon and his
blades, hands and feet represent the deadly weapons
of the wyrms that inspired the style in their deadly
prowess. When wielding two weapons in this stance,
all melee attacks and unarmed strikes made ignore a
targets damage reduction and inflict bleeding wounds
on foes, inflicting 2d4 points of bleed damage per round.
A successful DC 20 Heal check or the application of any
effect that cures hit point damage will stop the bleeding.
THRASHING BLADES
Discipline: Thrashing Dragon (Strike)
Level: 8
Prerequisites: 3 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instant
With the speed and ferocity of a rampaging dragon,
the disciple rends his foe to ribbons with his furious
onslaught as he turns the quickening principles
of fighting many opponents to fight only one. The
initiator may make a full attack action at his foe, each
attack at full attack bonus (with no reduction from
iterative attacks), with both wielded weapons and
any natural attacks or unarmed strikes the initiator
possesses. Each of these attacks inflicts an additional
2d6 points of damage due to the sheer ferocity of the
attack. The price for this ferocity is that the initiator
must leave himself open to some attack; until his next
turn the initiator suffers a -4 penalty to his AC and to
Reflex saves.
DEADLY DRAGON STRIKE
Discipline: Thrashing Dragon (Strike)
Level: 9
Prerequisites: 4 Thrashing Dragon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One or two creatures
Duration: Instant
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Upon reaching mastery of the Thrashing Dragon
discipline, the disciple learns the truth of his deadly
war dance; at its center is a deadly calm. It is in this
calm that he discovers the true nature of his art
and that one perfect blow can spell instant death
for a foe. The disciple analyzes his foes in the blur
of combat and finds his perfect moment and strikes
for the heart and pierces it through. The initiator
makes an attack roll against one or two foes using his
two weapons (both attacks made through this strike
are made at full attack bonus) and if these attacks
are successful, his weapon perfectly and precisely
pierces the foes heart or other vital zone, killing it
instantly on a failed Fortitude save (DC 19 + initiation
modifier). Even if the creature successful saves, the
strike inflicts his weapons damage plus an additional
12d6 points of damage from the trauma of the blow.
The initiator can use this strike to attack the same
target with both attacks, forcing the target to make
two Fortitude saves as above. Creatures immune to
precision damage are not subject to the death effects
of this strike.

The disciple can befuddle and bewilder his
opponent with this strike, causing a grave imbalance
in the psyche of the victim. The initiator must make
a successful attack against the target, inflicting an
additional 2d6 points of damage and the target must
attempt a Will save (DC 12 + initiation modifier) or
suffer a -4 to all d20 rolls until the disciples next turn.
FADING STRIKE
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Strike) (Teleportation)
Level: 2
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: Up to the disciples movement speed
Duration: Instant
The disciple learns the basic technique at this
level for walking between worlds to reach locations
that previously could be inaccessible on the mortal
world and potentially attack foes at those locales. As
a standard action, the initiator may either teleport
to a location no farther away than his maximum
movement speed, and make an attack action against
an opponent as part of the same standard action, or
attack an adjacent target and then teleport to a location
no farther away than his maximum movement speed.
The teleportation destination must be clearly seen by
the disciple to teleport to that location, and it must be
unoccupied.

Level: 2
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Instant
By momentarily slipping through the barrier
between the Material and the Astral planes, the
Veiled Moon disciple may attempt to avoid an attack
by being incorporeal. The initiator makes an opposed
Stealth check against the attackers Perception check;
if successful the initiator is incorporeal for that attack
(resolve the attack against the initiator as normal for
striking an incorporeal target). This counter may
be attempted to defend against targeted and area
of effect spells, making a Stealth check in place of a
Reflex save.
RESONANCE STRIKE
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Strike) [Force]
Level: 2
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instant

ALTERED PENUMBRA
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Counter) (Teleportation,
Figment)
Level: 3
Prerequisites: One Veiled Moon maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Instant
Position is relative to the Veiled Moon disciples
thinking, and his position in the universe is mutable.
Using these principles, the disciple may circumvent
reality to remove himself from harms way when
necessary. TThe initiator makes a Stealth check
opposing the attackers Perception check. If successful
then the initiator may teleport to any spot within 10-
ft. away from his current position and leave a minor
image duplicate of himself behind to take the attack
of his foe in his place. Minor images created by this
counter last for 1d4 rounds or until dispersed. This
ability may be used to defend against spells and effects
that directly target the initiator with an attack roll
(such as ranged touch effects) or for those that allow
for a Reflex save. If the attack would still encompass
an area to where the initiator is teleporting (such as
with the fireball spell he has not vacated), the initiator
would still be struck by the attack.
BRILLIANT MOON
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Strike)
Level: 3
Prerequisites: One Veiled Moon maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instant
By partially phasing a portion of his attack out of
this reality, the disciple may ignore certain obstacles,
such as armor, when striking at an opponent. The
initiator makes an attack roll and ignores the targets
armor bonus to AC (unless this armor bonus comes
from a force effect, such as mage armor). A successful
hit inflicts an additional 4d4 points of force damage
from the spiritual power the disciple infuses into the
attack.

Level: 4
Prerequisites: One Veiled Moon maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: 1d4 rounds
Saving Throw: Will negates
The moon is a source of madness, so the legend
goes, and by using the principles of lunar cycles on
the psyche of mortals, the disciple may temporarily
relieve a target of its sanity for a few moments in
combat. The initiator must make a melee attack
against a target creature, and if successful, in
addition to damage the target must make a Will save
(DC 14 + initiation modifier) or be confused (as the
spell confusion) for 1d4 rounds. After the application
of this maneuver, the subject briefly forgets that the
initiator exists and thus may not target the initiator
while confused.
ETHEREAL REMINISCENCE
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Teleportation)
Level: 4
Prerequisites: One Veiled Moon maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 full round action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: One round
The ectoplasmic nature of beings on the Ethereal
plane allows for the Veiled Moon disciple to briefly
transport himself to that realm and use his will to
restore some his form by filling his wounds with
spectral energies, displacing his injuries but at a great
potential risk. As a full round action, the initiator
may become incorporeal for one round and restore
twice his ranks in Stealth in hit points to himself.
Every time the initiator makes the transition between
planes, however, he runs the risk of potentially losing
himself there briefly. The initiator initiating this
maneuver must make a Will save (DC 14, +1 DC for
every time hes initiated this maneuver since he last
rested for 8 hours after the first use); if successful, the
maneuver works as normal. If the saving throw fails,
the initiator does not regain any hit points, instead
suffering 2d6 points of damage, and spends the next
2d4 rounds lost in the borderland between the Prime
Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, and when he
returns to the Prime, he is fatigued for an hour. This
is an Ethereal plane using maneuver.

Duration: Instant
In a flickering blur of teleportation and movement,
the Veiled Moon disciple may disappear, blink into
existence to strike a foe, and then disappear again to
appear a safe distance away. The initiator may teleport
up to his movement speed to a target enemy, make
an attack or a combat maneuver (such as disarm or
trip) against the foe using its flat-footed armor class
or CMD (denying the target his Dexterity bonus due
to the surprising nature of the attack), then teleport
away up to his movement speed, all without drawing
attacks of opportunity for the movement or attack.

Level: 5
Prerequisites: Two Veiled Moon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
By shifting his essence partially into the Astral
plane, the disciple finds that moving through that
plane as just as easy as moving through the Material
plane. While the disciple is in this stance, he may
teleport up to his movement speed as a move action,
or twice his movement speed as a full round action, at
will. He must see his destination clearly to be able to
teleport to it. The initiator may not take any creatures
with him when teleporting; only himself and the gear
he is carrying plus up to an additional 20 lbs. This
stance meets the qualifications for the Dimensional
Agility feats, should the initiator wish to take them.

Level: 5
Prerequisites: Two Veiled Moon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 full round action
Range: Melee touch
Target: Up to three targets
Duration: Instant
By creating temporary breaches between the worlds
of the Material and the Astral, the disciple may teleport
through a few enemies and emerge from the space
between worlds having done his foes great internal
harm. The initiator makes a melee touch attack against
a target, and may teleport to another target no more
than 20-ft. from the first (and do the same for a third
target) making another melee touch attack on each
subsequent target and inflicting 10d6 points of force
damage to all affected. On a failed attack or after the
final target, the disciple appears up to 15-ft. from
the final target to finish his turn. The touch attacks
themselves cannot be unarmed strikes or weapon
strikes that inflict damage normally; the disciple must
lay their hand against the target in a non-damaging
way to initiate this maneuver (even if wielding a
weapon in that hand, this can be used by simply
touching the target with a fist or back of the hand).

To slip through the worlds is a simple matter for
the disciple, and using this to deceive and evade an
attacker is effortlessly done. The initiator makes
a Stealth check against the attackers Perception
check. If the disciple succeeds he is able to teleport
to a position up to 20-ft. away, gain the incorporeal
subtype, and leave behind 1d6 major images where
his previous position lay. Major images persist until
they are slain or until 4 rounds have elapsed and
the initiator remains incorporeal until his next turn.
This ability may be used to attempt evade spells and
effects that directly target the initiator or for those
that allow for a Reflex save. This is an Ethereal plane
using maneuver.
SPIRITUAL WEAPON STANCE
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Counter) [Force]
Level: 6
Prerequisites: Two Veiled Moon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
By channeling ethereal energies along his weapons
and his body, the initiator becomes immersed in both
worlds, being as solid on the Ethereal Plane as he is
on the Material. While in this stance, the initiators
weapons, armor, and equipment are treated as if they
had the ghost touch property (ammunition retains
the property until used), and his attacks inflict an
additional 2d6 points or force damage. As a sideeffect of this empowerment from the Ethereal plane,
this energy acts a buffer against magical attacks, and
grants the disciple spell resistance equal to 5 + his
initiator level. This is an Ethereal plane using stance.
VAPORFORM CRASH
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Strike) [Force]
Level: 6
Prerequisites: Two Veiled Moon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature
Duration: 1d4 rounds
The Veiled Moon teaches that its disciples must
know how to balance the scales between both
worlds, so to make a foe real in the Material world,
then the disciple must briefly sojourn to the other
side. The disciple makes a melee attack against an
incorporeal target, and if successful the target loses
their incorporeal subtype for 1d4 rounds and takes
12d6 points of force damage (incorporeal foes lose
their Charisma bonus to AC and have a Strength
score equal to their Charisma score -4; all incorporeal
equipment temporarily becomes corporeal with the
target). The disciple gains the incorporeal subtype for
a like number of rounds (losing his Strength score and
gaining a +4 bonus to Charisma and he may apply his
Charisma bonus to his AC as a deflection bonus; all
of his equipment becomes temporarily incorporeal
with him as well). This is an Ethereal plane using

unreal. The initiator makes an attack on a target
creature and if successful, the strike inflicts 12d6 points
of force damage in place of normal damage, and the
target gains the incorporeal subtype for 1d4 rounds
(see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 1 for further details).
The target must make a Will save (DC 17 + initiation
modifier) to negate the incorporeality portion of this
strike or only his body becomes incorporeal and
items held in his hands do not, falling to the ground
at their feet. This strike does not function on targets

Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
The Veiled Moon disciple pulls himself fully into
the Ethereal and manifests a ghostly apparition of
his form upon the Material, and in doing so he locks
his immediate area for travel through the Ethereal
or Astral plane. While in this stance, the initiator
gains the incorporeal subtype and anyone within
30-ft. of his position who attempts to use an effect
with the [Teleportation] type likely fails. The disciple
can exclude allied creatures from this effect. Those
effected can attempt an opposed initiator level check
(using their caster or initiator level) to successfully
execute their teleportation effect. Once outside of
this stances range, creatures are no longer affected.
If two or more instances of Anchoring Spirit overlap,
they cease functioning until separated. This is an
Ethereal plane using maneuver.

Target: Special
Duration: Instant
Folding space around his form effortlessly, the
disciple is capable of leaps through the ether and
attacking through the barrier between the worlds
in a series of staccato bursts of silvery-blue light, his
image blinking as he strikes. As a full attack action,
the initiator may make an attack against a target and
then teleport a distance up to his movement speed to
a new target to strike again, and each attack is made
against the targets flat-footed armor class. He may do
this a number of times equal to the number of attacks
he possesses on a full attack action (including off
hand attacks or secondary attacks), and he may select
the same target for each attack but each teleportation
must land him in position to make an attack against

LUNAR PENUMBRA
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Counter) [Teleportation]
Level: 8
Prerequisites: Three Veiled Moon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal. Close (25-ft. + 5-ft./2 initiator levels)
Target: You and one target
Duration: Instant
It is said that the moon is portrayed in some legends
as a laughing trickster, and with this powerful ability,
the Veiled Moon disciple is capable of pulling an
incredible trick upon his foe. The initiator makes a
Stealth check against his foes Perception check. If
successful he and his attacker switch positions, and
the attack that was directed against the disciple now
affects the attacker, effectively causing the target to
strike itself. This ability may be used to evade spells
and effects that directly target the initiator or for
those that allow for a Reflex save (but if the initiator
is still within the radius of the effect, he still is struck
by it).
BANISH TO THE BEYOND
Discipline: Veiled Moon (Strike) [Teleportation]
Level: 9
Prerequisites: Four Veiled Moon maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee touch
Target: One creature
Duration: Special (see text)
Saving Throw: Will partial
The ultimate technique of the Veiled Moon disciple
is the ability to lay a mark against a target and shunt
it gently into the Astral plane where it may ponder its
reasons for crossing the likes of a master. The initiator
makes a melee touch attack against a target, who
then makes a Will save (DC 19 + initiation modifier).
Failure indicates that the target is shifted fully into
the Astral plane, body and all, and the target may
not return to the Material plane for one hour. If the
foe has no way to return to the Material plane after
this duration has expired, he is effectively stranded
and must find his own way back to his world. If the
target succeeds his saving throw, he is still shunted
to the Astral plane, but returns automatically to the
Material plane after one minute. While in the Astral
plane, the target is tethered to his body at the location
he occupied before being pushed into the Astral Plane
with a silver cord as normal (per astral projection).

is the ability to restrict an opponents movement—prevent
their escape or halting their advance. Your basic but potent
strike allows you to harry and disrupt a foe until they lay
down their arms. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals
weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at
a Will save (DC 11 + your initiation modifier) or become
cursed and unable to move within your threatened area
(including with 5-foot steps and using the Withdraw action)
without provoking an attack of opportunity from you for
24 hours. If the target drops all weapons it is holding, it can
make another saving throw to end this effect. An affected
target that is not holding a weapon can draw or pick up a
weapon, then drop it to gain a new saving throw, but can
never gain more than one save per round against this curse.STRIKE OF THE INFINITE PROTECTOR

functions regardless of the distance between you and the
target, although it cannot teleport a target on another plane
of existence. For every 10 feet the target moves during its
turn preceding the teleportation, the save DC of this strike
increases by +1 (up to a maximum of a +3 increase to the

counter, your threatened area increases to 20 feet for one
round. This overlaps with, rather than stacking with, any
natural reach you otherwise have; if your natural reach is
greater than 20 feet, it is not reduced. In addition, for the
duration of this boost, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus

you, it takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks
(including special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The

Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm

hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction
is not split with you because it is not hit point damage.

Reflex save (DC 15 + your initiation modifier) or become
blinded for one round, averting its eyes as a result of utter

of light off of a blade and emerging from a mirror, a prism,
or even the reflection in an enemys eye. When you initiate
this boost, you can teleport to any unoccupied space within

You conjure a shard of black glass, imprisoning not only
your enemys power but the very concept of the tool he
attempts to use. You can initiate this counter in response to
opponent within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 initiator
levels) casting a spell, initiating a maneuver, manifesting a
power, or using a psi-like or spell-like ability. Make a Craft
check opposed by your opponents caster level, initiator

Level: 8
Prerequisites: Three Shattered Mirror maneuvers

With a casual blow, you annihilate your opponents
perceptions, writing and rewriting their senses until theycan only perceive reality as a shattered ruin. Make an attack.
If it hits, your attack deals weapon damage as normal plus
an additional 6d6 points of damage, and you make a Craft
check, using the targets CMD as the DC. If you succeed, the

any power, psi-like ability, spell, and/or spell-like ability that
targets an opponent within 30 feet also affect a number of
secondary targets equal to your initiation modifier. Each
secondary target must be within 30 feet of you, and none
can be affected more than once. If the original effect requires
an attack roll, use the same roll for each target. If the effect

as the primary target, and if it does not deal damage, its save
DC is reduced by 4 instead.

Prerequisites: Four Shattered Mirror maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature

The ultimate expression of your reflective power creates a
mirror behind your victim just before you strike them with
your magic-laced blade, blowing their soul out of their body
and into your trap. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals
weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed
at a Will save (DC 19 + your initiation modifier) or die
instantly, their soul becoming trapped for seven years in a
small steel mirror that appears somewhere on your person.
If they succeed at their save, your attack instead deals 13d6
additional damage. Destroying the mirror created by this
strike frees your victims soul, allowing it to be returned to
life as normal.
BATTLE MANTRA
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Stance)
Level: 1
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
In the heat of battle, every second matters, and every blow
is crucial. Your focus and psionic abilities allow you to detect
subtle movements and mental impressions, reacting to the
ever-changing melee before those changes manifest. While
you maintain this stance, you gain one of the following
benefits.
• You gain a +1 insight bonus to your AC.
• You gain a +1 insight bonus on all attack rolls.
• You gain a +2 insight bonus on combat maneuver
checks and to your CMD.

attention to another facet of the combat, losing your
current bonus and gaining a different benefit from this
stance. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four initiator
levels you possess.
BODY OF DELUSION
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Counter)
Level: 1
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal or 60 ft. (see text)
Target: You or one ally (see text)
Duration: Instantaneous
The most basic tenet of the Sleeping Goddess discipline is
that a strong enough belief, channeled through the lens of
psionic power, can do anything. With this technique, you
momentarily enter a state of denial, asserting through your
power that you are not and will not be harmed. You can
initiate this counter when you take damage from a melee
or ranged attack. Make an Autohypnosis check, using
your opponents attack roll as the DC. If you succeed, you
take only half damage from the attack, although any other
effects of the attack are resolved normally.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:• For every power point you spend, you gain a +1 bonus
on your Autohypnosis check.
• If you spend 3 power points, you take no damage from
the attack on a successful Autohypnosis check, rather
than half.
• If you spend 5 power points, you are completely
unaffected by the attack on a successful Autohypnosis
check, taking no damage and ignoring any additional
effects of the attack.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating
this counter, you can use it in response to an attack
damaging an ally within 60 feet. Make an Autohypnosis
check as normal, then apply the effects of this counter
to that ally rather than yourself.
CALL THE SOULS BLADE
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Boost)
Level: 1
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level (see text)
As an adept of the Sleeping Goddess discipline, your greatest
weapon is your personal ideology given form. By focusing
on all you view as right and just, you can shape psionic
might into a souls blade. When you initiate this boost, a
souls blade appears in your hands, taking the form of a
masterwork melee weapon you are proficient with. A souls
blade created with this boost has hardness 10 and 10 hit
points, and is treated as a magic weapon for the purposes of
overcoming damage reduction. The blade lasts a number of
rounds equal to your initiator level before vanishing. If you
throw your souls blade or otherwise relinquish your grip on
it (such as by being disarmed), it dissipates after one round
unless you reclaim it. You can have multiple souls blades
created at once if you initiate this boost or other boosts
that create a souls blade multiple times, although only as
many as you can wield.
If you are currently wielding a mind blade or equivalent
weapon (such as a deadly fists empowered strikes, a psychic
armorys panoply of blades, or a soulbolts mind bolt), you
can choose to amplify it instead of this boosts normal
effects. Until the start of your next turn, all such weapons
you wield (including those created after initiating this
boost) gain the benefit of a weapon special ability
equivalent to a +1 enhancement bonus. This
ability must be chosen from the list of weapon
special abilities you can normally place on your
mind blade (see the enhanced mind blade
class feature in Chapter 3 of Ultimate Psionics).

a –2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks
for one round. Each time one of your allies successfully hits
that creature while it is under the effect of this strike, the
duration increases by one round, up to a maximum number
of rounds equal to your initiator level.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:

against a non-instantaneous effect that allows a saving
throw affecting them. This saving throw has the same DC as
the original save. If your ally succeeds, the effect ends. The
ally does not suffer any additional effects for failing the save
(such as a poisons damage). You cannot grant an ally more
than one additional save against a given effect.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:

target must succeed at a Will save (DC 11 + your initiation
modifier) or for one round, any attacks from your allies
against the target deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.

more of the following ways:
• For every 2 power points you spend, the additional

Target: You
Duration: Stance
With careful steps and focused psionic power, you can
slightly shift how you interact with the world, moving over
liquids as if they were solid, sprinting along walls, and even
walking through the air. While you maintain this stance, you
can walk and stand on liquids and other unfirm surfaces as
if they were solid ground. You can move at your normal
speed, but you cannot run on such a surface. This stance
does not protect you from any negative effects that the
surface might carry, such as the heat of lava or the stickiness
of a spiders web.
At initiator level 5th, you gain the ability to move along
walls and ceilings as if under the effect of a spider climb
spell while you maintain this stance, except that you do not
need to use your hands to climb and can fight normally. At
initiator level 10th, you can walk through the air as if it were
solid ground, gaining a fly speed equal to your land speed
with good maneuverability while you maintain this stance.
However, while flying in such a way, you cannot hover. At

this way increases to perfect, and you can even stand still in
midair, hovering as normal.

melee or ranged attack being made against you. You gain a
+4 insight bonus to your AC against that attack, potentially
causing it to miss. In addition, one of your allies within 60

more of the following ways:
• For every power point you spend, the insight bonus to

Level: 3
Prerequisites: One Sleeping Goddess maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
The term “sleeping goddess” refers not to any tangible entity,
but a state of being; by focusing your psionic might through
the lens of true belief, you become something akin to a
minor divine power whose realm lies within your physical
form. Through this power, you can outright deny the world
when it tries to exert such paltry concepts as “reality” on
you. While you maintain this stance, you gain the following

with an attack or succeeded at a combat maneuver

order to defend yourself, creating a momentary psionic link
along which the effects of their attack are shared. You can
activate this counter when you take damage from an attack

INARGUABLE PRESENCE OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Stance)
Level: 5
Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
Your psionic might and the strength of your belief exert
an immense pressure on the minds of your foes merely by
being near them. You are a fact, and your power will not
be denied. While you maintain this stance, your maneuvers
and other abilities treat creatures that are normally immune
to mind-affecting effects as if they were not immune. Such
creatures gain a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws
against your mind-affecting effects, rather than ignoring
them outright. In addition, attacks made against you suffer
a 20% miss chance.
RESHAPE THE SCULPTED MIND
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Strike) [mind-affecting]
Level: 5
Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous (see text)
Your intimate acquaintance with the nature of the mind
allows you to strike it where its most vulnerable. Make an
attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an
additional 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
damage (your choice), and the target must succeed at a
Will save (DC 15 + your initiation modifier) or be affected
by one of the following effects, depending on the type of
ability damage selected. A target that is immune to ability
damage still suffers this additional effect.
Intelligence: The targets ability to express its thoughts is
dampened, causing it to be unable to communicate with
others, even by telepathy, for a number of rounds equal
to the Intelligence damage dealt by this strike. The target
can still hear others, but anything it says or tries to convey
nonverbally is completely unintelligible, even to a creature
under the effect of a tongues spell or similar effect. Spells
that require verbal components suffer a 50% chance of
failure while the target is affected by this strike.
Wisdom: The target loses its grasp on reality, causing it
to become confused for a number of rounds equal to the
Wisdom damage dealt by this strike.
Charisma: The targets confidence and ability to believe
in itself is shattered, causing it to become frightened for a
number of rounds equal to the Charisma damage dealt by
this strike. At the end of each of the targets turns while it
is frightened, it can attempt another save to end this effect.
This use of this strike is considered a fear effect.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every 2 power points you spend, the ability
damage dealt by this strike increases by one.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
strike, you ignore any immunity to mind-affecting
effects or fear effects the target possesses. Instead, a
normally-immune target gains a +5 resistance bonus
on its saving throw.

Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: 30 ft.
Target: One or more creatures (see text)
Duration: Instantaneous
As you destroy one foe, his allies feel the weight of his failure,
the pain, fear, and feeling of utter defeat cascading down
the ties of friendship or belief. You can activate this boost
when you reduce an opponent to 0 or lower hit points.
Each of that opponents allies within 30 feet must succeed
at a Will save (DC 15 + your initiation modifier) or become
shaken and sickened for a number of rounds equal to your
initiation modifier.
THE TIES THAT BIND

Level: 5
Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack and 60 ft. (see text)
Target: One or more creatures (see text)
Duration: Instantaneous (see text)
With a psionically-empowered strike, you stab through an
enemys physical form and attack their spirit and those tied
to it. In the minds of your targets, the world warps, keeping
them from fighting or moving effectively. Make an attack. If
it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional
5d6 points of damage, and the target must succeed at a
Will save (DC 15 + your initiation modifier) or it and one
of the targets allies within 60 feet of your choice become
entangled for a number of rounds equal to your initiation
modifier. The targets ally does not receive a saving throw
against this effect.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every power point you spend, this strike deals an
additional 1d6 points of damage. For every 2d6 you
increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike
increases by +1.
• For every 3 power points you spend, you may select an
additional one of the targets allies to entangle if the
target fails its saving throw.• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
strike, the target and its affected allies also become
nauseated for one round on a failed saving throw.

Range: Personal and 30 ft. (see text)
Target: You (see text)
Duration: 1 round (see text)
With a practiced flourish of your weapon and a surge of
spiritual might, you tear magic asunder and redirect its
power to assist your allies. You can initiate this counter
when in response to being targeted by or within the area
of a power, psi-like ability, spell, or spell-like ability. Make an
Autohypnosis check with a DC of 11 + the effects caster or
manifester level. If you succeed, the effect is negated, and
all allies within 30 feet of you gain a competence bonus on
saving throws equal to 1/2 your initiation modifier for one
round.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every 2 power points you spend, the bonuses
granted by this counter last an additional round.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
counter, you can use it in response to an ally within
60 feet being targeted by or within the area of a power,
psi-like ability, spell, or spell-like ability. If you do, make
an Autohypnosis check as normal, then apply the
effects of this counter to that ally rather than yourself.
Your allies within 30 feet of that ally gain the bonus on
saving throws from this counter.
DREAMING NOMAD STRIKE
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Strike) [teleportation]
Level: 6
Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 full-round action
Range: Melee attack and 50 ft. (see text)
Target: One or more creatures (see text)
Duration: Instantaneous
You force reality around you to become dreamlike,
eschewing the restrictions of distance and becoming a
whirlwind of strikes flowing across the battlefield without
needing to take a single step. When you initiate this strike,
you may teleport to any space within 50 feet from which you
could make a melee attack against an opponent. After you
teleport, make a melee attack against that opponent. If it
hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and you can repeat
this process, teleporting to a space within 50 feet of your
new location. The maximum number of attacks you can
make in this way is equal to one plus an additional attack
for every four initiator levels you possess, and each attack
is made at your highest attack bonus. You cannot attack an
individual creature more than once during this strike.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every power point you spend, this strike deals an
additional 1d6 points of damage. For every 2d6 you
increase the damage by, the distance you can teleport
before each attack increases by 10 feet.
• For every 2 power points you spend, the maximum
number of attacks you can make with this strike is
increased by one.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
strike, you may teleport to any open space within 50
feet at the conclusion of this strike, whether or not the
strike ended because you missed an attack or because
you made all possible attacks.
OVERPOWERING OPTIMISM
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Boost)
Level: 6
Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 3 rounds
Your faith in yourself allows you to press the advantage
further than most—by believing you can succeed, you
change yourself into someone who will. When you initiate
this boost, you instantly regain your psionic focus. In
addition, you may augment a maneuver you initiate within
the next three rounds without spending power points,
gaining the benefits of the maneuver as if you had spent
the maximum number of power points you could spend on
that maneuver. You may not spend additional power points
when augmenting a maneuver in this way, nor does this
maneuver allow you to spend more power points than you
would normally be allowed to.
UNAVOIDABLE GAZE OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Stance)
Level: 6
Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal (see text)
Target: You (see text)
Duration: Stance
You open your senses, gaining perfect awareness of the
world around you with your enhanced perception. While
you maintain this stance, you gain a bonus on initiative
checks equal to your initiation modifier. You do not need
to make Perception checks to notice creatures; you can
detect and pinpoint all creatures within 60 feet. You also
ignore miss chances granted by concealment, darkness, and
invisibility, although you still must have line of effect to a
creature or an object to discern it.
In addition, you can expend your psionic focus as a
move action to pierce creatures minds as easily as yoursenses pierce darkness. For a number of rounds equal to
your initiation modifier after activating this ability, you can
read the surface thoughts of all creatures within 60 feet as
if you had manifested the read thoughts power. A creature
can make a Will save (DC 16 + your initiation modifier)
to keep you from reading their thoughts. A creature that
successfully saves against this effect is immune to having its
surface thoughts read by this stance for 24 hours. You do
not need to concentrate on this ability to maintain it. This
use of this stance is considered a mind-affecting effect.
STRIKE OF TRANSFIXED AWE
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Strike)
Level: 6
Prerequisites: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 Standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous (see text)
Your strike momentarily alters the flow of magic around your
opponent, viciously rending power from their mind. Make
an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus
an additional 6d6 points of damage, and the target must
succeed at a Will save (DC 16 + your initiation modifier)
or become stunned for one round. In addition, if the target
fails its save, you learn their caster level or manifester level
(if any) and the target loses their highest level unexpended
spell slot as if they had cast it (chosen at random) and power
points equal to their manifester level. A target that cannot
cast spells or does not possess power points is unaffected by
this additional effect.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every power point you spend, this strike deals an
additional 1d6 points of damage. For every 2d6 you
increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike
increases by +1.
PERFECT DISTILLATION OF THE SOUL
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Boost)
Level: 7
Prerequisites: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level (see text)
Your souls blade is unparalleled in form, shining as a beacon
of your will and ideals, and carving through your foes as
well as even the most powerful magic weapons. When
you initiate this boost, a souls blade appears in your hands,
taking the form of a +5 melee weapon you are proficient
with. Alternatively, you may create two souls blades, each
taking the form of an identical +4 melee weapons you are
proficient with. A souls blade created with this boost has
hardness 20 and 50 hit points. The blade lasts a number of
rounds equal to your initiator level before vanishing. If you
throw your souls blade or otherwise relinquish your grip on
it (such as by being disarmed), it dissipates after one round
dissipates after one round unless you reclaim it. You can
have multiple souls blades created at once if you initiate
this boost or other boosts that create a souls blade multiple
times, although only as many as you can wield.
If you are currently wielding a mind blade or equivalent
weapon (such as a deadly fists empowered strikes, a psychic
armorys panoply of blades, or a soulbolts mind bolt), you
can choose to amplify it instead of this boosts normal
effects. Until the start of your next turn, all such weapons
you wield (including those created after initiating this
boost) gain the benefit of a single weapon special ability
equivalent to up to +3 enhancement bonus. This ability
must be chosen from the list of weapon special abilities you
can normally place on your mind blade (see the enhanced
mind blade class feature in Chapter 3 of Ultimate Psionics).
PIERCE THE SOUL
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Strike)
Level: 7
Prerequisites: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature (see text)
Duration: Instantaneous
You deliver a deadly blow to an enemy with a familiar or
similar bond, striking through the mystic ties between
master and servant. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals
weapon damage as normal plus an additional 7d6 points
of damage. If your target is an animal companion, eidolon,
familiar, psicrystal, or similar creature with a telepathic or
empathic link to another creature (including creatures
within a collective or under the effect of a mindlink power
or telepathic bond spell, although not including creatures
communicating with the telepathy ability), you can choose
to deal this attacks damage to the creature that your target
is linked to. The target can make a Will save (DC 17 + your
initiation modifier) to negate this transfer of damage; if it
succeeds, it takes the strikes damage as normal. The linked
creature does not receive a saving throw against this effect.
You automatically know whether or not the target is such
a creature when this strike hits, although you do not learn
the identity of the creature linked to it. If the target is linked
to multiple other creatures, then the damage is transferred
to one of them at random. This strike can transfer damage
across any distance, although it cannot damage a creature
on another plane of existence from the target.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every power point you spend, this strike deals an
additional 1d6 points of damage. For every 2d6 you
increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike
increases by +1.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
strike, you deal damage to both the target and thelinked creature. The target may still make a Will save to
negate the damage being dealt to that creature.
SOUL-CRUSHING MIEN
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Counter) [mind-affecting]
Level: 7
Prerequisites: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal (see text)
Target: You (see text)
Duration: 1 round
Your resolution proves dangerous, and able to damage
minds that even slightly contact your own. You can initiate
this maneuver when you are targeted or otherwise affected
by an effect that requires a Will save. You gain a +4 bonus
on that saving throw, and if you succeed, the originator of
the effect becomes stunned for one round.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every 2 power points you spend, the bonus on your
Will save increases by +1.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
counter, the originator of the effect is dazed for one
round if you succeed on your Will save, rather than
stunned. The creature still drops held items, takes a –2
penalty to its AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to its
AC (if any) as if it were stunned.
INDOMITABLE IDEALISM
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Counter)
Level: 8
Prerequisites: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal and 100 ft. (see text)
Target: You
Duration: Instantaneous
An idea cannot be killed as long as it still inhabits a mind.
As a master of the Sleeping Goddess discipline, you have
the ability to use this fact to your advantage, channeling
overwhelming psionic power through yourself for a brief
moment in order to become a living embodiment of your
ideals and beliefs. You can initiate this counter when you
would be killed or knocked unconscious, either through
damage reducing you to 0 or fewer hit points or by an
effect that kills you outright (such as a death effect or
a vorpal weapon). You do not take the damage or are
completely unaffected by the effect, and may move to
a space adjacent to any creature within 100 feet that has
seen you or otherwise knows who you are. This movement
does not provoke attacks of opportunity, nor does it require
line of sight or line of effect, although you must be aware
that the creature in question is in range. To observers, you
seem to vanish and reappear next to the creature, folding
out of space and becoming to all eyes a near-flawless, ideal
version of yourself for a few seconds before returning to
your normal appearance.
SELF BEYOND THE SELF
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Strike) [compulsion, mindaffecting]
Level: 8
Prerequisites: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous (see text)
With your studied understanding of the mind and its
motivations, beliefs, and ideals, you can temporarily subvert
the spirit of a foe, briefly making them into a staunch ally.
Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal,
and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 18 + your
initiation modifier) or fall under your complete control for
one round, as if you had manifested a Geths mind control
power on them, although it can affect any creature type,
not just humanoids.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every power point you spend, this strike deals an
additional 1d6 points of damage. For every 2d6 you
increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike
increases by +1.
• If you spend 6 power points, the target is controlled for
an additional round.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
strike, you ignore any immunity to mind-affecting
effects the target possesses. Instead, a normallyimmune target gains a +5 resistance bonus on its
saving throw.
UNIMPEACHABLE AUTHORITY OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Stance) [fear, mind-affecting]
Level: 8
Prerequisites: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal (see text)
Target: You (see text)
Duration: Stance
You focus your spirit and belief, becoming a terrible
and awe-inspiring sight; the world around you pales in
comparison to your reality, and those who meet your eyes
can feel your presence boring into their very soul. You may
enter and maintain this stance even if you are immune to
mind-affecting effects or fear effects. While you maintain
this stance, opponents within 60 feet of you become
shaken. This stance cannot create a stronger fear condition
if an opponent is already shaken; affected opponents
merely remain shaken while they remain within 60 feet of
you (although other fear effects can do so as normal). In
addition, as a move action, you can turn your attention to an
opponent within 60 feet that can see or otherwise perceive
you. That opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC 18 +
your initiation modifier) or become panicked for one round.
If you expend your psionic focus as part of using this ability,
you ignore any immunity to mind-affecting or fear effectspossessed by the target. Instead, a normally-immune target
gains a +5 resistance bonus on its saving throw.
IMMORTAL TRUTHS OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS
Discipline: Sleeping Goddess (Strike) [mind-affecting]
Level: 9
Prerequisites: Four Sleeping Goddess maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Standing at the pinnacle of the Sleeping Goddess disciplines
students, you have the ability to share your beliefs in a way
that no others can. By making contact with your opponents
mind and soul, you can open a dialogue, communicating
your respective ideals instantaneously and debating their
merits. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals an additional 10d6
points of damage. If this damage would reduce the target
to 0 or fewer hit points, you can attempt to convert them
to your way of thinking, clashing beliefs in a brief moment
of spiritual contact. If you do, you and the target make
an opposed ability check, with you using your initiation
modifier and the target using its Charisma modifier. If the
target succeeds, they take damage as normal, potentially
killing them or knocking them unconscious.
If you succeed, the target is instead reduced to 1 hit point,
and their attitude towards you and your allies changes
to helpful. This is not a compulsion, nor is it forcing the
target to follow your orders, but rather the result of a
spiritual conversation that took place in the instant of
the strike. The target now understands your beliefs and
ideals and either believes in them as well or respects your
belief enough to be unwilling to oppose you. Regardless
of whether or not the target succeeds on their check, you
gain a deep understanding of their own beliefs and ideals.
While you have this maneuver readied and unexpended,
you automatically know the current hit point total of each
creature within your melee reach.
Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or
more of the following ways:
• For every power point you spend, this strike deals an
additional 1d6 points of damage. For every 2d6 you
increase the damage by, you gain a +1 bonus on your
ability check.
• If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this
strike, you ignore any immunity to mind-affecting
effects the target possesses.DISARMING SHOT

Duration: Instant (see text)
You strike with an akashic brand that imbalances a creature. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal and the target becomes branded with a number of akashic brands equal to your initiation modifier. These brands last for one minute or until otherwise consumed. When a creature attacks another creature that has been branded this way, they may remove one of the brands as a part of the attack to attempt a combat maneuver of their choice against the branded creature. Ranged attackers may not choose to grapple or move with the target if the combat maneuver would normally allow it (such as if using a bull rush), but may otherwise freely select combat maneuvers. When determining their combat maneuver bonus for this strike, creatures may use your initiator level in place of their base attack bonus, and may choose to use your initiation modifier in place of their Strength modifier. Each creature may remove only one brand per round. These combat maneuvers do not provoke an attack of opportunity. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this strike lowers the branded creatures CMD by 1 for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier.

At initiator level 10 and every five initiator levels thereafter, the market price of the weapon special ability you can grant a weapon increases (to “+2 bonus”, then “+3 bonus”, and so on). A weapon can only gain a single ability through this stance, though you need not grant the same ability to each affected weapon. A weapon retains its new ability for as long as it remains within close range. You choose which weapons are empowered when you enter this stance, and you can change which weapons within range are empowered as a swift action or as part of reallocating essence.

STAND OF THE SUNLIGHT SHIELD
Discipline: Radiant Dawn (Stance); Level: 5
Prerequisite(s): Two Radiant Dawn maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance
This stance sits halfway between martial form and magic prowess, conjuring shields of light to defend yourself and others. While you maintain this stance, you may create sunlight shields. Creating a single sunlight shield is done as free action that can be done once per round, and is done automatically when you enter this stance. A sunlight shield can be created anywhere within close range (25 feet plus 5 feet per 2 levels) of you (to include in the air, where they float until destroyed, dismissed, or removed). Treat a sunlight shield as a 10ft by 10ft by 1 inch thick wall of force, but with hardness equal to your initiator level plus your initiation modifier, and 1 hit point. They may be made smaller at the initiators discretion. You may have a number of sunlight shields equal to your initiation modifier, and these shields last indefinitely, or until they are no longer within close range of you, you dismiss them as a free action, or you leave this stance. These sunlight shields can be made at any angle, and are treated as normal terrain when stepped on. You may command these shields to fly an amount of feet equal to your movement speed as a move action. You may also create a sunlight shield as an immediate action, but doing so is dangerous as the hasty construction leaves your essence tied to it. Until the start of your next turn, any damage that the shield takes (before hardness is taken into account), or any spell that would fail because of the shields sudden appearance between its caster and its target is also inflicted on you, regardless of distance. Creatures can attack other creatures on the other side of these shields, dealing damage to the shield first. If an attack would break the shield, the remainder of the damage is dealt to the creature if the original attack would have hit. When you enter this stance, you may designate any number of allies. These allies attacks and abilities are not impeded by your sunlight shields. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this stance increases the hardness of the sunlight shields by 3, the number of sunlight shields you create when entering this stance by 1, and the number of sunlight shields you can possess at one time by 2.

Once per round, as a free action that can be taken at any time (including when it is not your turn), you may create a line with a length of 20 feet that originates anywhere within this light. Unlike normal line attacks, this line attack does not need to fire away from you; it may travel in any direction so long as the origin point is within your daylight range. Enemies within the area take damage equal to your initiator level. A successful Reflex save (DC 16 + initiation modifier) halves this damage. Allies caught within the line are instead healed for a number of hit points equal to your initiator level. Essence: Each point of essence invested in this stance allows you to affect one additional target adjacent to the line and increases the DC of the Reflex save by 1.

Whenever the target would deal damage, as a free action that can be done on any turn, the creature that took damage may remove the brand, and only take half of the damage that they would have taken from the attack. The branded creature then takes half of the damage mitigated this way. Essence: Each point of essence invested in this maneuver increases the healing done by 8 points and the number of brands placed on the creature after a failed will save by 1.
