Taking this training to the theater of war, a punch so
potent that it can leave the foe sickened with pain is
what this art form can deliver. The initiator makes
an attack against the target creature and if successful,
this attack inflicts an additional 12d6 points of
damage that ignores the targets damage reduction or
an objects hardness. If striking a living creature, the
target must make a Fortitude save (DC 17 + initiation
modifier) or be nauseated with the pain of the strike
for 1d4 rounds.",7,icons/svg/sword.svg

The Broken Blade master has transcended the
simple use of his own body as a weapon, and has
deigned to use his opponents body as a weapon
against those who would stand against him. The
initiator makes a grapple attempt and if successful,
he may hurl his foe up to 25-ft. as a ranged touch
attack at either the ground or another target foe. The
thrown enemy suffers 12d6 points of damage upon
impact, and if thrown at a target creature, that target
suffers that damage as well on a failed Reflex saving
throw (DC 18 + initiation modifier for half damage).
The target of this grapple attempt must be within
one size category of the initiator. Large or larger
foes being hurled using this method may target the
ground beneath multiple targets within the area that
creature normally would occupy. (Large creatures,
for example, occupy a 10-ft. by 10-ft. space so they
would hit all targets within a 10-ft. by 10-ft. area on a
failed Reflex save).",8,icons/svg/sword.svg

thunder from the force of the blows. Those witnessing
this strike implemented rarely forget it, and those
that feel it rarely survive it. The initiator makes a full
attack and each strike inflicts an additional 4d6 points
of damage that ignores damage reduction. After the
attacks are made, the target must make a Fortitude
save (DC is 19 + initiation modifier). Each successful
hit increases Fortitude save by +1 per attack to resist
this strike; failure on the Fortitude save indicates that
the target is reduced to -1 hit points.",9,icons/svg/sword.svg

BLADE-BREAKING COUNTER
Discipline: Primal Fury (Counter)
Level: 3
Prerequisites: One Primal Fury maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Instant
An opponent cannot hurt you with his weapon if
a weapon does not exist to do it. The Primal Fury
disciple takes this to heart with a powerful parrying
blow designed to shatter the weapon that his opponent
uses before it can strike him. When being attacked,
this counter is initiated after a successful hit but
before damage is inflicted. The initiator then makes
an immediate sunder attempt with a +2 circumstance
bonus on his foes weapon (which does not provoke
attacks of opportunity), and if the weapon is reduced
to half of its hit points, then it gains the broken
condition and the disciple takes half damage from the
attack. If this sunder attempt reduces the opponents
weapon to 0 hit points, then the weapon shatters and
the disciple takes no damage. If the initiator possesses

an attack against his target and if successful, inflicts
an additional 4d6 points of damage to this attack

Inevitably, the disciple of Steel Serpent will be struck
in combat and through the use of this technique; he
learns to make his foe regret its actions. Just as the
cobra often poisons the foolish mongoose, so does the
disciple of Steel Serpent poison his foe. Upon being
struck in combat, the disciple takes advantage of the
opening that his injury makes available and strikes
out once with poisoned, life sapping ki energies. Make
an immediate attack at full base attack bonus against

Discipline: Steel Serpent (Strike) [Death]
Level: 9
Prerequisites: Four Steel Serpent Maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack or ranged attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Instant
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
A true master of the discipline of Steel Serpent
possesses the knowledge how to use his skill, ki, and
knowledge of the systems of living creatures, putting
them to use for ending of a life. When a disciple initiates
this maneuver and strikes a foe, he shows his deadly
intent and knowledge in a display of terrible force,
striking a foes heart chakra and sending a cascade of
poisonous ki through its body to annihilate the lifeforce
of the target. The disciple makes an attack against a foe
which if successful the target must make a Fortitude save
(DC 19 + initiation modifier). If this save fails, the target is
instantly slain as its bodys energies revolt and consume
it in a flash, reducing the body to ash (equipment is
unharmed). If the target succeeds on this save, its body
still suffers from the experience as the attack inflicts an
additional 50 points of damage. If the target dies from
this, its body also dissolves into ash. Victims slain by this
attack cannot be resurrected normally; a wish or miracle
spell must be cast first to restore the life-forceof the
victims spirit before any raise attempt can be attempted.
This is a supernatural ability",8,icons/svg/skull.svg
LEAPING DRAGON,swift,You,,Instant,Personal,,,Thrashing Dragon (Boost),"As a dragon takes wing, his powerful legs thrust
him skyward as his wings spread out to clutch the
air. The disciple of the Thrashing Dragon uses this

gains a +10 competence bonus to his Acrobatics check
and is treated as if he had a running start.",1,icons/svg/explosion.svg
OFFENSIVE ROLL,full,One creature,,Instant,Melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"As the disciple moves by his opponent, he may
drop into a tumbling roll and strike at it from a
surprising angle. The initiator must move at least 10
ft. alongside an enemy (which provokes attacks of
opportunity unless the initiator is using Acrobatics
to tumble) and make a Acrobatics check with a DC
equal to the targets Armor Class. If successful, the
target is considered flat-footed and the strike inflicts
an additional 1d6 points of damage. The character
initiating this maneuver may move up to his full

moment.",1,icons/svg/explosion.svg
SWIFT CLAWS,standard,One creature,,Instant,Melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"The Thrashing Dragon disciples skill with his dual

FLASH KICK,swift,One creature,,Instant,Melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Boost),"As part of a full attack action, the disciple may make
a powerful and swift kick while his blades strike. The
initiator makes an additional unarmed strike against
a target as part of his full attack action at his full attack
bonus but suffers a -2 penalty. If this attack hits then
it inflicts an additional 2d6 points of damage. The
character does not provoke attacks of opportunity

FLICK OF THE WRIST,full,One creature,,Instant,Melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"With two rapid slaps from his blades, the Thrashing
Dragon disciples ferocity puts an opponent off
balance and with a flick of the wrist the disciple takes
away the weapon of his foe. The initiator makes two
rapid attack rolls at his full base attack bonus against
the targets AC with a +2 bonus. If both attacks are
successful, the target is disarmed of his primary
weapon (no roll needed). Resolve damage from the
two attacks made as part of this strike as normal. If
the target is using natural attacks or the target has a
locked gauntlet, then this maneuver is ineffective for
disarming a foe.",2,icons/svg/explosion.svg
REFLEXIVE TWIST,immediate,Personal,,Instant,One melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Counter),"With his athletic abilities and reflexes honed to
a razors edge, the Thrashing Dragon disciple may

normal.",2,icons/svg/explosion.svg
SWEEPING TAIL,standard,One creature,,Instant,Melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"Within his battle dance, the disciple dips low and
sweeps his leg out to knock an opponent down. The

Dragon spins low and attacks at the legs of the target to

Upon successfully striking a target in melee combat

DEVASTATION ROLL,standard,One creature,,One round,One melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"The martial disciples movements are so quick and
precise, his deadly strikes are hard to evade. With
a sudden twist and jump through the opponents
defenses, the disciple strikes hard into the exposed
and undefended foe. The initiator must move at least
10-ft. through two spaces that his opponent threatens
and make a Acrobatics check equal to the targets CMD
(this roll counts as both a check to use the maneuver
as well as to negate potential attacks of opportunity
from moving through a threatened area). If successful,
make an attack against the targets flat-footed Armor

of damage.",4,icons/svg/explosion.svg
DRAGON ASSAULT,1 full round attack action,One creature,,Instant,One melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"By unleashing his full wrath against his enemies,
a Thrashing Dragon disciple is capable of inflicting
incredibly powerful blows that get more potent per
successive hit. The initiator makes a full round attack

normal damage. Each subsequent successful attack
inflicts an additional 1d6 points of damage that carry

through a successful attack with a vicious kick to his
foe to keep punishing the fool who would stand before
the might of a Thrashing Dragon. Upon successfully
striking a foe as part of an attack, martial strike, or a
full attack, he may as a swift action use this maneuver
to deliver a vicious kick at his full attack bonus with
his unarmed strike. This attack inflicts an additional
3d6 points of damage.",4,icons/svg/explosion.svg
SHARPENED TALONS,swift,You,,Instant,Personal,,,Thrashing Dragon (Boost),"As a dragon might drag his claws across a castle

THRASHING DRAGON TWIST,standard,Any adjacent target,,Instant,One melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"Like a coiled spring, the disciple of the Thrashing
Dragon twists his body and with powerful recoil,
he spins to swipe at all of his available targets. The
initiator attacks surrounding foes while fighting
with two weapons, making an attack roll with both
wielded weapons against each target at full base
attack bonus (effectively making two attacks on
each target, one with each weapon) against each
enemy that he threatens. If the initiator is capable of
making an unarmed strike or natural attack (through
Improved Unarmed Strike feat or natural weapons)

attack, also at full base attack bonus.",5,icons/svg/explosion.svg
HURRICANE OF FANGS,swift,You,,One round,Personal,,,Thrashing Dragon (Boost),"Utilizing this technique, a Thrashing Dragon disciple

accuracy and range. For one round, the range of
thrown weapons with range increments (such as
daggers) or thrown weapons from an associated
Thrashing Dragon weapon group (improvised

REVERSING THRUST,immediate,You,,Instant,Personal,,,Thrashing Dragon (Counter),"By watching the form of the enemy attacking
him, the disciple may expertly twist and dodge way
from the attack while making an attack on his foe in

disciple evades and negates his foes attack and may
make an immediate counter attack at his full attack
bonus.",5,icons/svg/explosion.svg
TAIL SLAP,standard,One creature,,Instant,One melee attack,Fortitude,partial,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
As the true dragon fights and employs all of its
mighty limbs in combat, so does the disciple that
emulates their graceful and deadly style. As part of this
strike, the initiator makes a normal melee attack and if
successful, the disciple makes an additional powerful
spinning kick, landing a heavy blow to his foe which
may temporarily rob it of its senses. The initiator
makes an attack against a foe at full base attack bonus.
If successful, the attack inflicts additional damage
equal his unarmed strike damage plus an additional
6d6 points of damage and potentially stuns his foe.
On a failed Fortitude saving throw (DC 16 + initiation
modifier) the foe is stunned for 1d4 rounds. If the
saving throw is successful, the foe is merely dazed for
one round. The character does not provoke attacks of
opportunity for not possessing the Improved Unarmed
Strike feat when using this strike, but additional
damage from this strike inflicts non-lethal damage
unless the character possesses that feat.",6,icons/svg/explosion.svg
GREAT WYRMS FANG,standard,One creature,,Instant,One ranged attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"By focusing his will into one of his blades, the
Thrashing Dragon disciple wields the power of a
mighty great wyrm in the palm of his hand. The

RENDING CLAWS,swift,One creature,,Instant,Melee,,,Thrashing Dragon (Boost),"When both of his blades strike home, the Thrashing

piercing or slashing damage) or natural weapons
that do slashing or piercing damage against a single
target, the initiator may rend his opponent inflicting
an additional 8d6 points of damage.",6,icons/svg/explosion.svg
UNBREAKABLE TALONS,swift,You,,One turn,Personal,,,Thrashing Dragon (Boost),"Using his superior skill and speed, the disciple knows
where and how to strike for maximum effectiveness.
By striking at the right angle, the disciples blades
set off discordant harmonies within the target for
increased destructive potential. When two-weapon
fighting with bladed weapons or with natural attacks
that inflict slashing damage, the disciples attacks
with those weapons inflict an additional 4d6 points
of damage for the round and strike as if they were
adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming
damage reduction or sundering items.",6,icons/svg/explosion.svg
ALACRITY ON WING,immediate,You,,Instant,Personal,,,Thrashing Dragon (Counter),"With reflexes honed from many combats, the disciple
may react to danger with speed so great he may even
attack multiple times while he evades the unlucky

attack is negated and the initiator may make a melee
attack with two wielded weapons or unarmed strikes,
each dealing an additional +2d6 points of damage.",7,icons/svg/explosion.svg
THRASHING DRAGON FRENZY,standard,Any adjacent target,,Instant,One melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"By focusing on the principles of speed and power,
the Thrashing Dragon disciple explodes into motion,
making a vicious flurry of strikes against all nearby
attackers in a deadly dance of death. Make two attacks
with two-wielded weapons (making two attack rolls
with each weapon, effectively making four attacks)
against each adjacent enemy that surrounds the
initiator. If the initiator is capable of making an
unarmed strike or natural attack (through Improved
Unarmed Strike feat or natural weapons) then the
initiator may add in two additional attacks per target
using his unarmed or natural attack.",7,icons/svg/explosion.svg
DOOM TALON,swift,You,,Instant,Personal,,,Thrashing Dragon (Boost),"When a potentially deadly strike occurs, the
Thrashing Dragon disciple knows how to make the
blow count. When the initiator makes an attack
roll that scores a critical threat, as a swift action
the initiator may automatically confirm this critical
hit and inflict an additional 4d6 points of damage.
Creatures immune to critical hits may still be affected
by this strike, not taking the normal double damage
but still suffering the additional 4d6 points of damage.",8,icons/svg/explosion.svg
THRASHING BLADES,standard,One creature,,Instant,Melee attack,,,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"With the speed and ferocity of a rampaging dragon,
the disciple rends his foe to ribbons with his furious
onslaught as he turns the quickening principles
of fighting many opponents to fight only one. The
initiator may make a full attack action at his foe, each
attack at full attack bonus (with no reduction from
iterative attacks), with both wielded weapons and
any natural attacks or unarmed strikes the initiator
possesses. Each of these attacks inflicts an additional
2d6 points of damage due to the sheer ferocity of the
attack. The price for this ferocity is that the initiator
must leave himself open to some attack; until his next
turn the initiator suffers a -4 penalty to his AC and to
Reflex saves.",8,icons/svg/explosion.svg
DEADLY DRAGON STRIKE,standard,One or two creatures,,Instant,Melee or ranged attack,Fortitude,partial,Thrashing Dragon (Strike),"Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Upon reaching mastery of the Thrashing Dragon
discipline, the disciple learns the truth of his deadly
war dance; at its center is a deadly calm. It is in this
calm that he discovers the true nature of his art
and that one perfect blow can spell instant death
for a foe. The disciple analyzes his foes in the blur
of combat and finds his perfect moment and strikes
for the heart and pierces it through. The initiator
makes an attack roll against one or two foes using his
two weapons (both attacks made through this strike
are made at full attack bonus) and if these attacks
are successful, his weapon perfectly and precisely
pierces the foes heart or other vital zone, killing it
instantly on a failed Fortitude save (DC 19 + initiation
modifier). Even if the creature successful saves, the
strike inflicts his weapons damage plus an additional
12d6 points of damage from the trauma of the blow.
The initiator can use this strike to attack the same
target with both attacks, forcing the target to make
two Fortitude saves as above. Creatures immune to
precision damage are not subject to the death effects
of this strike.",9,icons/svg/explosion.svg
DIMENSIONAL STRIKE,standard,One creature,,Instant,Melee or ranged attack,,,Veiled Moon (Strike),"By shifting slightly between two worlds, the disciple

successful, cause the target to suffer a -4 penalty to
the next d20 roll that he makes.",1,icons/svg/daze.svg
GHOST HUNTING BLOW,swift,You,,One round,Personal,,,Veiled Moon (Boost),"By reaching across the barrier between worlds,
the disciple may strike at disembodied spirits as
easily he would strike a normal mortal. Any and all

Ethereal plane using maneuver.",1,icons/svg/daze.svg

The disciple can befuddle and bewilder his
opponent with this strike, causing a grave imbalance
in the psyche of the victim. The initiator must make

additional 2d6 points of damage and the target must
attempt a Will save (DC 12 + initiation modifier) or
suffer a -4 to all d20 rolls until the disciples next turn.",2,icons/svg/daze.svg
FADING STRIKE,standard,Up to the disciples movement speed,,Instant,Personal,,,Veiled Moon (Strike) (Teleportation),"The disciple learns the basic technique at this
level for walking between worlds to reach locations
that previously could be inaccessible on the mortal
world and potentially attack foes at those locales. As
a standard action, the initiator may either teleport
to a location no farther away than his maximum
movement speed, and make an attack action against
an opponent as part of the same standard action, or
attack an adjacent target and then teleport to a location
no farther away than his maximum movement speed.
The teleportation destination must be clearly seen by
the disciple to teleport to that location, and it must be
unoccupied.

By momentarily slipping through the barrier

RESONANCE STRIKE,standard,One creature,,Instant,Melee or ranged attack,,,Veiled Moon (Strike) [Force],"By funneling his spiritual power into his attack,
the Veiled Moon practitioner may strike an opponent
with glowing silvery light on the Material or the
Ethereal plane. This strike is resolved as a melee or
ranged touch attack, and it inflicts 3d6 + initiator level

then the initiator may teleport to any spot within 10-
ft. away from his current position and leave a minor
image duplicate of himself behind to take the attack
of his foe in his place. Minor images created by this
counter last for 1d4 rounds or until dispersed. This
ability may be used to defend against spells and effects
that directly target the initiator with an attack roll

BRILLIANT MOON,standard,One creature,,Instant,Melee or ranged attack,,,Veiled Moon (Strike),"By partially phasing a portion of his attack out of
this reality, the disciple may ignore certain obstacles,
such as armor, when striking at an opponent. The
initiator makes an attack roll and ignores the targets
armor bonus to AC (unless this armor bonus comes
from a force effect, such as mage armor). A successful

BREATH OF THE MOON,standard,One creature,,1d4 rounds,Melee or ranged attack,Will,negates,Veiled Moon (Strike) (Mind-affecting),"Saving Throw: Will negates
The moon is a source of madness, so the legend
goes, and by using the principles of lunar cycles on
the psyche of mortals, the disciple may temporarily
relieve a target of its sanity for a few moments in
combat. The initiator must make a melee attack
against a target creature, and if successful, in
addition to damage the target must make a Will save

restore some his form by filling his wounds with
spectral energies, displacing his injuries but at a great
potential risk. As a full round action, the initiator
may become incorporeal for one round and restore
twice his ranks in Stealth in hit points to himself.

himself there briefly. The initiator initiating this
maneuver must make a Will save (DC 14, +1 DC for
every time hes initiated this maneuver since he last
rested for 8 hours after the first use); if successful, the
maneuver works as normal. If the saving throw fails,
the initiator does not regain any hit points, instead
suffering 2d6 points of damage, and spends the next

INDOMITABLE IDEALISM,immediate,You,,Instantaneous,Personal and 100 ft. (see text),,,Sleeping Goddess (Counter),"An idea cannot be killed as long as it still inhabits a mind.
As a master of the Sleeping Goddess discipline, you have
the ability to use this fact to your advantage, channeling
overwhelming psionic power through yourself for a brief
moment in order to become a living embodiment of your
ideals and beliefs. You can initiate this counter when you
would be killed or knocked unconscious, either through
damage reducing you to 0 or fewer hit points or by an
effect that kills you outright (such as a death effect or
a vorpal weapon). You do not take the damage or are
completely unaffected by the effect, and may move to
a space adjacent to any creature within 100 feet that has
seen you or otherwise knows who you are. This movement
does not provoke attacks of opportunity, nor does it require
line of sight or line of effect, although you must be aware

motivations, beliefs, and ideals, you can temporarily subvert
the spirit of a foe, briefly making them into a staunch ally.
Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal,
and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 18 + your

IMMORTAL TRUTHS OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS,standard,One creature,,Instantaneous,Melee or ranged attack,,,Sleeping Goddess (Strike) [mind-affecting],"Standing at the pinnacle of the Sleeping Goddess disciplines
students, you have the ability to share your beliefs in a way
that no others can. By making contact with your opponents
mind and soul, you can open a dialogue, communicating
your respective ideals instantaneously and debating their
merits. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals an additional 10d6
points of damage. If this damage would reduce the target
to 0 or fewer hit points, you can attempt to convert them
to your way of thinking, clashing beliefs in a brief moment
of spiritual contact. If you do, you and the target make
an opposed ability check, with you using your initiation
modifier and the target using its Charisma modifier. If the
target succeeds, they take damage as normal, potentially
killing them or knocking them unconscious.
If you succeed, the target is instead reduced to 1 hit point,
and their attitude towards you and your allies changes
to helpful. This is not a compulsion, nor is it forcing the
target to follow your orders, but rather the result of a
spiritual conversation that took place in the instant of
the strike. The target now understands your beliefs and
ideals and either believes in them as well or respects your
belief enough to be unwilling to oppose you. Regardless
of whether or not the target succeeds on their check, you
gain a deep understanding of their own beliefs and ideals.
While you have this maneuver readied and unexpended,
you automatically know the current hit point total of each
creature within your melee reach.
